    <p>Hello guys!
        My name is Tiago. I'm from Brazil, but currently I live in Detroi-MI. I have moved to here 8 month ago.
        I work remontly for a company in Brazil and my wife is doing her PhD in chemestry at WSU University.
        We have been married since 2020.
        I love soccer. My favorite team is Figueirense - the best team of Santa Catarina State where I'm from.
        I'm learning to like basketbool, hockey and american footbaal. Since I'm living here in US I had a chance to go and to
        watch a Detroit Pristons Basktebool game and Red Wings Hockey game. I loved it!

        <p>I'm here to learn about programming and web development. I'm sure that BYU-Idaro will provide to us a great place to learn
        and improve our professional skill along with spiritual streghthen.
